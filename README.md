# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project for the dataset `country_wise_latest.csv`. The goal of this project is to analyze the data, identify trends, and gain insights through various statistical and visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Handling missing values and ensuring data cleanliness.
- Visualizing the data using advanced charts and heatmaps.
- Exploring correlations, distributions, and outliers.
- Generating insights into numerical and categorical variables.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values by replacing them with column means.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Heatmaps to identify missing data and correlations.
  - Histograms for numerical feature distributions.
  - Pair plots for relationships among variables.
  - Count plots for categorical data analysis.
  - Boxplots to detect outliers in numerical data.
- **Aggregations**: Calculating country-wise statistics.
- **Save Cleaned Data**: Exports the cleaned dataset for further use.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
